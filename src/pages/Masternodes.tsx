      question: "What is masternode?",
      answer:
        "A Masternode is a specially configured wallet that will support the network in more ways than a normal staking wallet. These functions require 10,000 NSDCs to start and therefore the user is rewarded for both supporting the network and locking the collateral.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I run a Masternode?",
      answer:
        "Being a Masternode holder is incentivized by being rewarded more NSDC than stakers through the higher block reward. Masternode reward is equal to 80%, while staking reward is 20% per block.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does it mean to lock coins as Masternode collateral?",
      answer:
        "Your 10,000 NSDC is still yours to completely control, however should you spend the 10K NSDC your masternode will stop and you will no longer earn block rewards. The 10,000 locked NSDCs simply act as collateral and allow you and your masternode server to secure the NSDC network.",
    },
    {
      question: "What Are The Minimum Hardware Requirements?",
      answer:
        "It is recommended that the machine running the NSDC wallet has 2GB RAM, although 1GB RAM with 1GB swap is fine. Additionally, a single core processor is sufficient to run the network. With these low requirements, itâ€™s possible to run the entire network on a 2GB RAM model Raspberry Pi.",
